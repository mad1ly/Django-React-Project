**ABOUT THE PROJECT**

This is a project I made to refine my Python Django and React.js knowledge, by famously combining them together and making a Web app that uses Spotify API.
You can create a room, where you are able to control your Spotify music, with your friends.

Big Thanks to Tech with Tim!
